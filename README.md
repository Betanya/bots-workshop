# Bots Workshop
Building bots is a fun and useful way to spend your time. Whether it is increasing
productivity in Slack or having fun in Discord, building a bot takes you through
the entire development lifecycle, from idea to deployment. 

This repository contains the finished code and curriculum that I use for leading
programming workshops about bots. This repository is not setup to properly 
deploy to a PaaS and is meant more for a singular reference point. 

## Current Bots
Below is a list of current bots that are implemented

### Discord

*Randombot* - Random bot is a simple bot that flips coins, picks a card, and 
rolls all the die (and dX).

### Slack

*Randombot* - Random bot is a simple bot that flips coins, picks a card, and 
rolls all the die (and dX).

## Deployment
All bots here are tested and work with DigitalOcean's App Platform. View the 
README in the individual directories for more information
